# Art-of-the-Bomb
In order to maintain the apprehension and disquiet of Halloween Dr. Evil has distributed digital bombs across the iLabs. Thankfully, Evil's Doctorate is in the Fine and Performing Arts, not Computer Science, so you are entirely capable of defusing any of the bombs by examining its assembly using GDB. There are too many bombs for one person to defuse, so you must each download one of Evil's bombs and defuse it. Each bomb consists of 9 phases. You must enter the code sequence on STDIN in order to defuse each phase. If you enter the correct code string for a phase the bomb will advance to the next phase. If you enter an incorrect code, the bomb will explode. It will print out “BOOM!!!” and terminate. The bomb will be completely defused if you enter the code sequence for all nine phases. If you want to quit where you are be sure to break out of the bomb. Exploding it by giving it bad code sequences will cost you points.
